Imagine if time could forever capture those happiest childhood moments—how beautiful life would be. While we can't return to the past, our memories can offer solace. To me, past memories are like a utopia—pure and uncomplicated. These five images capture the joy of childhood play and the tender dreams of adolescence. Oscar Wilde once said, "A world map without utopia is not worth looking at." By using a blurred technique, I invite viewers to create their own interpretations. I hope to evoke a sense of utopia and encourage people to hold onto these dreams, letting memories be a refuge in times of exhaustion.

The tone of these will picture be moody, cool and dark as most of the Balenciaga outfit, style are presented with all black.For these group of picture I’d involved for the art direction, photography and photo editing.

</span><span class="v17_390">For my personal preference, I gravitate towards a clean and gloomy aesthetic. I prefer simplicity in my creations, avoiding unnecessary elements. My daily experiences are my primary source of inspiration, influencing my minimalist approach. I find that this style allows the core message to shine through, creating a powerful and evocative impact. Embracing simplicity helps me focus on the essence of the concept, ensuring clarity and depth in my work.</span><span class="v17_403">UTOPIA</span><span class="v17_404">BALENCIAGA
